### ExplainShell  
Website: [https://explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com)  
Breaks down complex Linux shell commands into understandable parts using `man` pages. Great for learning what each option and flag does.

Example:  
Try entering `nmap -sS -T4 10.10.11.10 -Pn` to see a breakdown of the flags.

## Notes

- This section is for helper tools that aid in analysis, learning, or productivity.
- If a tool doesn't clearly fit into other categories like Enumeration, PrivEsc, or Reverse Shells â€” it goes here.
